# Deep-Learning-Glaucoma-Detection-using-Mask-RCNN


Glaucoma is a prevalent ocular disease, which leads to irreversible loss in vision because the optic nerves, that are connected directly to the brain gets damaged. 
Compared to the healthy fundus image, enlargement of an optic cup could be ob-served by covering a portion of the optic disc in the fundus image of glaucoma.

Ophthalmologists believe that it can be treated to some extent if early detection is possible. Several studies have been done so far in this eld. However, the detection
and segmentation of the optic cup and disc is a challenging task. Therefore, in this paper, a dierent deep learning approach is adopted to detect and segment the
prominent location of optic disc and cup from the fundus image using Mask RCNN.

The promising result by Mask-RCNN could be seen in other state-of-art in detect-ing and segmenting salient objects from images. This work is formulated on high
resolution public available RIGA dataset of fundus images comprises of ophthal-mologists labeled data. Various performance metrics such as F1 score, Precision,
Recall, Accuracy has been analysed in this study.
